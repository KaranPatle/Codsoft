Task No-1 Basic Calculater Using C++

This C++ program functions as a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input. The program first prompts the user to input an operator (+, -, *, or /), followed by two numbers on which the operation will be performed.

Key Features:

Operator Input: The user inputs a mathematical operator (+, -, *, or /).

Number Input: The program then asks for two numbers as operands.

Switch-Case Structure: A switch statement is used to determine the operation based on the user-selected operator. The valid operations include: Addition (+) Subtraction (-) Multiplication (*) Division (/)

Division by Zero Check: If the user selects division and attempts to divide by zero, the program handles this error gracefully by displaying an error message ("Error: Cannot divide by zero!").

Invalid Operator Handling: If the user inputs an invalid operator, an error message ("Error: Invalid operator!") is displayed.

Example Operations: Addition: If the user inputs + and numbers 5 and 3, the program outputs 5 + 3 = 8. Division by Zero: If the user tries to divide by zero, the program outputs Error: Cannot divide by zero!. This simple program demonstrates basic user input, conditional logic, error handling, and output formatting in C++.
