Task No-3 To Do list Using C++
This C++ program is a simple console-based To-Do List that allows users to manage their tasks. The program supports four main functionalities:

Add Task:

Users can add tasks to the to-do list by providing a description of the task. Each task is stored as a structure with two attributes: a description and a completion status (initially set as pending).
Display Tasks:

The program can display all tasks in the list along with their current statusâ€”either Pending or Completed.
Mark Task as Completed:

Users can mark specific tasks as completed by selecting the task number from the list. Once a task is marked, its status changes to Completed.
Remove Task:

Users can remove tasks from the list by selecting the task number. This removes the task from the vector of tasks.
The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can interact with the tasks and modify them as needed. It keeps running until the user chooses to exit the application.

Key Features:
Task Management: Add, view, complete, and remove tasks from the to-do list.
Simple Interface: Menu-driven program for easy interaction.
Status Tracking: Differentiates between completed and pending tasks.
This program demonstrates the use of basic data structures, loops, and user interaction in C++.
